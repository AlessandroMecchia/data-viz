	export_2020.csv
	
# Protocol 
1. Added a new column named "Total", which contains the sum of all pesticide quantities for each row.  
2. Removed all individual pesticide columns and any other irrelevant or unnecessary columns.  
3. Merged additional information such as "name", "region", and "alpha-3" codes from the `ISO-3166-Countries.csv` dataset.  
4. Renamed "Area" to "Country" and "region" to "Continent" and removed "name" for better clarity and consistency.  
5. Calculated the percentage contribution of each country's total pesticide quantity to the overall total quantity, adding this as a new column.
6. Filtered the data to include only records from the year 2020.
7. Divided the dataset into two subset: one containing only import data and the other containing only export data.
